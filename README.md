## Features

- [x] Discord bot
- [x] REST API
- [x] Front-end

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20.0.0 or higher)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (v3.0.0 or higher)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.0.0 or higher)

### Ubuntu / Debian

1. Node.js 
	- Check to be well In your original directory 
	- `cd ~`
	- use curl to retrieve nodejs version 20 installation script 
	- `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o nodesource_setup.sh`
	- Inspect the contents of the downloaded script with nano (or your favorite text editor): 
	-`nano nodesource_setup.sh`
	- You can now install the Node.js package the same way you did in the previous section: 
	-`sudo apt install nodejs`

2. Dependencie 
  - `apt install ffmpeg -y`
  - `sudo curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp \
    -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
    sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
    yt-dlp --version`

3. Prisma
	- Normally no manual installation required

4. 
	- regular version of pnpm, which needs Node.js to work.
	- `npm install -g pnpm or npm install -g @pnpm/exe`

5. I advise you to install pm2 
	- `npm install pm2 -g`

Now you can follow the installation instructions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with the following variables:

```env
    # The port the server will listen on
    PORT=3000
    # The Discord bot token
    DISCORD_TOKEN=
    # Config the Discord Status
    DISCORD_STATUS_NAME=The best Bot ever
    DISCORD_STATUS_STATE=The Best AI Bot
    # Number of servers per shard, 15 is the default number and it is recommended to put 15 to 200 servers per shard for optimal operation
    SERVERS_PER_SHARD=15
    # Owner ID for whitelist command
    OWNER_ID=
```

Check that the `.swcrc` file is created in the root directory and fill it with the following variables:

```
{
  "jsc": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "parser": {
      "syntax": "typescript",
      "tsx": false,
      "decorators": true,
      "dynamicImport": true
    },
    "transform": {
      "react": {
        "runtime": "automatic"
      }
    }
  },
  "module": {
    "type": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "strictMode": true,
    "noInterop": false
  },
  "minify": false,
  "sourceMaps": true
}
```

4. Run the database migrations with `pnpm migrate` (this will create the database tables)
5. Build the project with `pnpm build` and `pnpm add sharp`
6. Run the project with `pnpm start` or `node dist/main.js` or with pm2 `pm2 start npm --name "your-app-name" -- start`
6. Run the project with Shards with `node dist/shard.js` or with pm2 `pm2 start dist/shard.js --name "shardingstarting" -- start`

## Updating

1. Pull the repository with `git pull`
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run the database migrations with `pnpm migrate`
4. Build the project with `pnpm build`
5. Restart the project with `pm2 restart your-app-name`

Or if you don't want to "build" the project :

1. Change the branch to `prod` with `git checkout prod`
2. Same as above but without the `pnpm build` step
