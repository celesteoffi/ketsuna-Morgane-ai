# Ketsuna (Back/Front)

This is the full back-end and front-end of Ketsuna. It is a REST API built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/). It also contains a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) that is used to communicate with the Discord API.
The Front-end is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Features

- [x] Discord bot
- [x] REST API
- [x] Front-end

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20.0.0 or higher)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (v3.0.0 or higher)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.0.0 or higher)

### Ubuntu / Debian

1. Node.js 
	- Check to be well In your original directory ```env cd ~```
	- use curl to retrieve nodejs version 20 installation script ```env curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o nodesource_setup.sh```
	- Inspect the contents of the downloaded script with nano (or your favorite text editor): ```env nano nodesource_setup.sh```
	- You can now install the Node.js package the same way you did in the previous section: ```env sudo apt install nodejs```

2. Prisma
	- Normally no manual installation required

3. 
	- regular version of pnpm, which needs Node.js to work.
	- ```env npm install -g pnpm or npm install -g @pnpm/exe```


Now you can follow the installation instructions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with the following variables:

```env
    # The port the server will listen on
    PORT=3000
    # The Discord bot token
    DISCORD_TOKEN=
    # Config the Discord Status
    DISCORD_STATUS_NAME=The best Bot ever
    DISCORD_STATUS_STATE=The Best AI Bot
```

4. Run the database migrations with `pnpm migrate` (this will create the database tables)
5. Build the project with `pnpm build`
6. Run the project with `pnpm start` or `node dist/main.js` or with pm2 `pm2 start npm --name "your-app-name" -- start`

## Updating

1. Pull the repository with `git pull`
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run the database migrations with `pnpm migrate`
4. Build the project with `pnpm build`
5. Restart the project with `pm2 restart your-app-name`

Or if you don't want to "build" the project :

1. Change the branch to `prod` with `git checkout prod`
2. Same as above but without the `pnpm build` step

## Usage

/ai imagine `text` `[nsfw]` (Used to determine if it's NSFW or not, don't work outside of NSFW channels) `model` (The model to use, default is `deliberate`) `negative_prompt` (The prompt to filter what you don't want)
/ia login (Used to login to the AI Horde API, you need to have an account on the [AI Horde](https://stablehorde.net/) website)
